# Bundling

On Pikachu, bids are placed off-chain and not immediately executed, but rather collected and aggregated in a private mempool to later be settled in bundles that conform to the [Flashbots Spec](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/understanding-bundles).

Bundling allows Pikapool to be competitive in getting bids mined, passing on savings to the NFT creator.
