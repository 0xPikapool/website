# Welcome to Pikapool
Pikapool is an NFT specific Mempool built by some of the best pokemon trainers around. Leveraging recent innovations in the blockchain space around transaction bundling, Pikapool is able increase mint revenue for NFT projects while keeping the gas auction user experience the same without any of the negative side-effects!

## About Pikapool
The primary focus of Pikapool is to enable both builders & artists in the NFT space to accrue more revenue without complicating the process of engaging with NFT communities. Two core ideas drive us: 1) NFTs are a paradigm shifting technology and 2) It makes no sense that thousands of ETH end up wasted in gas wars & failed transactions every year. We believe these fees should be in the hands of the projects responsible for gas wars in order to create long lasting and sustainable value in NFT communities.

Pikapool is comprised of the Blockchain industries leading Pokemon trainers. On the side, the team dabbles in block building, MEV research, smart contract development, and on-chain analytics. When the team isn't spending their time battling gym leaders, they hack away on projects aimed at moving the crypto space forward.

While this might sound like a grandiose mission, so is "catching them all". That didn't stop Ash!
