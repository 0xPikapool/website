# Pikapool Auctions

## Overview

Pikapool can conduct auctions for any OpenZeppelin ERC721 contract with AccessControl enabled.

Bidders submit their auction bids to Pikapool where the are ordered by tip.

Once the auction closes, the winning bids (those with the highest tip) are settled on-chain via the SettlementContract.

## Pikapool Auction Properties

- Maximises profit for creators: auction proceeds go directly to the NFT creator, rather than an Ethereum validator like in regular gas-price auctions

- Gas efficient: only successful bids with the highest tip are settled on-chain

- Trustless: the Pikapool operator is bound by the rules specified in the on-chain SettlementContract, and is never able to steal funds even if were compromised or went rouge

## Meta-transactions

Meta-tranasctions allow Pikapool to

- securely collect and organise bids off-chain

- settle only winnings bids on-chain

</span>


To enable meta-transactions, users approve the SettlementContract to execute signed bids on their behalf and the NFT creator grants the SettlementContract a Minter role using OpenZeppelin [AccessControl](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#AccessControl).

Now, users craft and submit bids as meta-transactions to Pikapool.

When the auction closes, Pikapool gathers winning bids into bundles and submits them on-chain where the SettlementContract 1. verifies the bids are legitimate, 2. sends the tips to the NFT creator and 3. mints the NFTs to the winning addresses.

## Bundling

On Pikachu, bids are placed off-chain and not immediately executed, but rather collected and aggregated in a private mempool to later be settled in bundles.

Bundling bids allows Pikapool to be competitive in mining the bids, passing on savings to the NFT creator.

## Trustlessness

In Pikapool V1, while auctions are conducted by a central orchestrator they are still trustless to the extent that the orchestrator can never steal funds, and can never censor transactions in secret.

The orchestrator is never able to spend user funds expect on bids that have been cryptographically signed by the user.

When a bid is submitted to Pikapool, the bidder is provided a signed receipt by the orchestrator attesting that the bid was submitted and will be considered in the auction.

When a mint is "closed for bids", the orchestrator reveals the list of bids it considered in the auction.

If the orchestrator misbehaved by settling transactions on-chain inconsistenly with the list of candidate bids, this could be proven by comparing the list of candidate bids with the actual on-chain settled bids.

If the orchestrator misbehaved by omitting a bid from the published list of candidate bids, this could be proven by the signed receipt of the omitted bid being circulated off-chain.

Pikapool is still committed to progressively decentralizing in V2 and V3 releases, drawing inspiration from [CoW Protocol](https://docs.cow.fi/overview/road-to-decentralization).
