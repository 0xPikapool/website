# Overview

Pikapool can conduct auctions for any OpenZeppelin ERC721 project that enables [AccessControl](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#AccessControl) for minting.

Bidders submit their auction bids as [ERC721 meta-transactions](https://medium.com/metamask/eip712-is-coming-what-to-expect-and-how-to-use-it-bb92fd1a7a26) to Pikapool, where the are ordered by tip.

Once the auction closes, the winning bids (those with the highest tip) are settled on-chain via the SettlementContract.

## Pikapool Auction Properties

- Maximises profit for creators: auction proceeds go directly to the NFT creator, rather than the Ethereum validator like in regular gas-price auctions

- Gas efficient: only the successful bids with the highest tip are sent on-chain

- Trustless: the Pikapool operator is bound by the rules specified in the on-chain SettlementContract, and is never able to steal funds even if were compromised or went rouge


## Trustlessness

In Pikapool V1, while auctions are conducted by a central orchestrator it is still trustless to the extent that the orchestrator cannot steal funds or misbehave in secret.

The orchestrator is never able to spend user funds expect on bids that have been cryptographically signed by the user.

When a bid is submitted to Pikapool, the bidder is provided a signed receipt by the orchestrator attesting that the bid was submitted and will be considered in the auction.

When a mint is "closed for bids", the orchestrator reveals the list of bids it considered in the auction.

If the orchestrator misbehaved by settling transactions on-chain inconsistenly with the list of candidate bids, this could be proven by comparing the list of candidate bids with the actual on-chain settled bids.

If the orchestrator misbehaved by omitting a bid from the published list of candidate bids, this could be proven by the signed receipt of the omitted bid being circulated off-chain.

Pikapool progressively decentralise in V2 and V3 releases.
