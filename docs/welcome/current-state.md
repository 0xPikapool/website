# Current NFT Landscape

## State of NFT Value Accrual
NFT projects normally make money through either their direct mint or royalties on the secondary market. With that being said, royalties for projects are in jeopardy and frankly, they didn't result in a meaningful amount of revenue for the most succesful projects. Of the top 5,000 most traded NFT's on Opensea, an average of 78% of lifetime revenue comes from minting fees.

If you want to make money, you *need* to maximize your mint revenue.

## NFT Minting Paradigm's
While plenty of NFT projects have worked on novel approaches to launching NFT's, most NFT mints breakdown into Allow List mints and Public mints; both using a static mint price. The static mint price caps the potential revenue from the NFT mint and gives no wiggle room for projects to earn more from their mint.

Although projects can build auction mechanism's into the token launch smart contract, this is uncommon and ruins some of the excitement surrounding NFT mints. Gas auctions have become a core part about what makes NFT's exciting. For minters, the gas auction is often the most thrilling part of buying an NFT during a public mint. For the project, a gas auction gurantees that resellers looking to make a small profit still sell high above the mint price.

## Gas Auctions
A hype public mint will almost always result in a gas auctions. In a gas auction, participants trying to mint NFT's will pay high gas fees for priority in line for the mint. Knowledge of how to navigate a gas auction can make-or-break an NFT minters experience, but they come with major negative externalities.

During gas auctions, participants can end up spending more on gas than on the actual NFT. Further, paying extremely high gas does not gurantee a participant an NFT. If the mint sells out, participants can end up paying high gas fees without any NFT in return. Finally, the NFT project that worked for months building a community, creating their NFT's, and building hype around the project don't earn any of the proceeds from the gas auction. Even if participants pay twice as much in gas for the NFT, the project only gets the mint cost. Gas fees go to the validator who is just churning through blocks.
