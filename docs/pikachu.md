# Introduction

Pikachu is a trustless protocol for NFT auctions.

Prospective buyers submit their bids to the Pikachu darkpool, where they are ordered by tip and settled on-chain in batch transactions.

## Why Pikachu?

Pikachu brings numerous benefits compared to a gas price action in the public mempool.

### Profit to creators, not validators

Money that would have been spent bribing validators in a gas price auction goes directly to NFT creators.

### Certianty and fairness for bidders

Bidders either receive the NFT for the price they are willing to pay, or don't pay anything. No more gas wasted on failed transctions.
