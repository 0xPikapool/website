Pikapool does for NFTs what [CowSwap](https://swap.cow.fi/) did for DEX trading.  Using an NFT specific mempool, projects can capture additional revenue from the inefficiencies of bidding in the public mempool. ⚡️Sometimes up to 50% of mint gas fees.⚡️

Pikapool is built by a team of Ethereum's leading Pokemon trainers and our final gym leader is negative externalities from NFT related first price auctions in the public mempool.  While this might sound like a grandiose mission, so is "catch ‘em all".
